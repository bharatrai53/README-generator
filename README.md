# READMEGenerator

## Description
The README Generator was created so that I could apply my skills with the inquire package and node.js. The purpose of this application is to autogenerate a README file based on questions that get prompted to the user. Upon answering all of the prompts we use the writefile function to create a readme.md file that autofills the user reponses to automate the process of creating a readme. 

## Usage
To use the application, run the file on the command line by typing node index.js file. The command line will prompt you with questions that you will need to answer and upon completion, you can check the 'dist' folder to see your customized README.md file.
